# l1-penalizing method
- Here is the code implementing the l1-penalizing method introduced in [Learning Multiple Quantiles With Neural Networks](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2021.1909601).
- The algorithm provides non-crossing quantiles estimates of response variable for given explanatory data.
- Additionally, projected gradient descent method and interior-point method for multiple quantiles are also included.
